        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        Hello! I'm Sasha Persaud, a passionate software engineer 
        with a strong foundation in both software development 
        and geographic information systems (GIS). I recently 
        graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology 
        with a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering and 
        a minor in GIS. With a diverse set of technical skills 
        ranging from Python and JavaScript to AWS and ArcGIS, 
        I am dedicated to creating innovative solutions that 
        bridge the gap between technology and real-world challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
        Throughout my academic journey and professional 
        experiences, I've had the opportunity to work on 
        a variety of impactful projects. From building a 
        Modbus server for digital electricity transmitters 
        at Voltserver Inc. to leading a team of interns at 
        TRC Companies, I thrive in collaborative environments 
        where I can both contribute and learn.
        </p>
        <p>
        In addition to my technical expertise, I am driven 
        by a commitment to continuous learning and adaptability. 
        Whether it's improving data processing scripts, 
        developing embedded systems, or conducting GIS research
        in Rwanda, I am always eager to take on new challenges 
        and grow as a professional.
        </p>
        <p>
        I am open to new opportunities and willing to 
        relocate for the right role. If you're looking for 
        a software engineer who is not only technically 
        proficient but also passionate about making a 
        difference, I'd love to connect!
